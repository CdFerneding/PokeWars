# PokeWars Game Design
## Game Idea:
PokeWars is a 2D real-time-strategy game heavily based on Age Of Empires (AOE), set in the Pokemon Universe. Players build and manage their own Poke Centers to train Pikachus and gather resources (for example berries). The player can build arenas to train fighting pokemon (pikachu is not able to attack and is dependent on the Protection of fighting pokemon). Fighting pokemon will be the starter pokemon, thereby implementing a “rock-paper-scissor” Mindgame fighting style. The goal is to build up a strong town and slay an Artificial Intelligence or another player. If you lose all friendly Pokemon, you will lose. 

## Key Concepts:
### PokeCenter: 
In AOE Poke Centers would be the Town Centers. Poke Centers can produce pikachu’s in exchange for berries from the player.
### Pikachu:
In AOE Pikachus would be the villager. Pikachu farms berries and wood to finance the expenses of building infrastructure and producing more Pikachus and fighting types.

### Game Patterns: 
#### Resource Management (Player-Bank):
Resource management mechanics, where the player must balance his production with the need of producing pokemon and researching upgrades. 
#### Unit Training and Evolution: 
Design of fighting pokemon production and an evolution System, where the player must make meaningful choices to get ahead of their opponents. 
#### RTS Elements:
Classic RTS mechanics like: unit selection and moving, building infrastructure and fighting strategy. 
#### Game Story:
Total Extinction of the legendary native birds, and their lineage, while not being eliminated by their children.
Save your berries and friends from being annihilated.
