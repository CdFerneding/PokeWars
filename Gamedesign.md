# PokeWars Game Design
## Game Idea:
PokeWars is a 2D real-time-strategy game heavily based on Age Of Empires (AOE), set in the Pokemon Universe. Players build and manage their own PokeCenters to train and evolve pikachu, gather resources (for example berries). They build arenas to train fighting pokemon (pikachu is not able to attack and is dependent on the Protection of fighting pokemon). Fighting pokemon will be the starter pokemon, thereby implementing a “rock-paper-scissor” Mindgame fighting style. The goal is to build up a strong town and slay an Artificial Intelligence or another player. If you lose your own PokeCenter, you will lose. 

## Key Concepts:
### PokeCenter: 
In AOE PokeCenters (PC) would be the Town Centers. TownCenters can produce pikachu’s in exchange for berries from the player.
Pikachu:
In AOE pikachu would be the villager. Pikachu farms berries, wood and stone, to finance the expenses of building infrastructure and producing more pikachu and fighting types.
### Map Exploration: 
Players can explore the map with pokemon to find more lavish resource options and bonuses. 
Game Patterns: 
Resource Management (Player-Bank):
Resource management mechanics, where the player must balance his production with the need of producing pokemon and researching upgrades. 
Unit Training and Evolution: 
Design of fighting pokemon production and an evolution System, where the player must make meaningful choices to get ahead of their opponents. 
### RTS Elements:
Classic RTS mechanics like: unit selection and moving, building infrastructure and fighting strategy. 
Pokemon Lore:
Implementation of the pokemon lore by incorporating different regions with different starter pokemon (aka. fighting pokemon). The different regions may have different perks or advantages which make them unique.
