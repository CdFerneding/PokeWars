# PokeWars Art Design
## Sources:
Sprites from https://sprites.pmdcollab.org/#/
pmdcollab contains a list of pokemon assets, including: a simple profile picture, attac-, move-, idle- (and many more) animations.

## The Art Style
The Art is heavily inspired by the Pokemon Artstyle and not created by us. The Game can therefore never be published unless we don’t create our own Sprites/Assets.
