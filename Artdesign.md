# PokeWars Art Design
## Sources:
Sprites from https://sprites.pmdcollab.org/#/
pmdcollab contains a list of pokemon assets, including: a simple profile picture, attac-, move-, idle- (and many more) animations. 

Tilemap “Berry Garden” from https://opengameart.org/content/a-pixel-art-collection

Sprites for the buildings are from https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/pokemonrubysapphire/sheet/8192/.
We recolored the arenas to adequately match the sujet.

The tree is from https://skalding.itch.io/2d-tree-free-sprite-002.

## The Art Style
The Art is heavily inspired by the Pokemon Artstyle and not created by us. The Game can therefore never be published unless we don’t create our own Sprites/Assets.
